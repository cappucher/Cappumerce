## How did I make this and how long did it take?
Around a little more than a month. I first learned NodeJS at the beginning of March of 2023, and created a basic wiki website without ExpressJS or a database. Needless to say, it was slightly verbose. 

After finishing this project, I finally decided to learn ExpressJS and SQL. Thus, I was able to create my first prototype of Cappumerce. However, this draft was missing a lot of features, including comments and the ability to end listings. In addition, it was pretty tedious having to write raw SQL statements in my code.

This brings me to April of 2023, where I learned sequelize and migrated to PostgreSQL. I finally finished my project, but I still am learning new technologies to make my projects better. In the future, I am considering using React with NextJS, and using a REST API or GraphQL.
